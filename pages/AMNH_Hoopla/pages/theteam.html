		<h1>Development</h1>
		<p>Hoopla is based on the <a
			   href="http://drphilmarshall.github.io/LensWrangler/">LensWrangler</a>
		prototype made by Stuart Lowe, Amit Kapadia, Aprajita Verma and Phil
		Marshall, but with many interesting modifications added by Nan Li. The main
		function library is "eelens.js" in this repository, which is an updated
		version of <a href="https://github.com/slowe/lensjs">lens.js</a>. It
		includes elliptical models of both lenses and sources.
