		<h1>What is Hoopla?</h1>
		<p>Hoopla is a simple javascript app for modeling images of strong
		gravitational lenses. It allows you to hand-craft a model lens out of
		elliptically-symmetric mass distributions (representing massive
		foreground galaxies) and elliptically symmetric light sources
		(representing faint background galaxies), and then dynamically predict
		the shape of the resulting gravitationally lensed image features as you
		tune the model. You can save your tuned model's parameters to a
		shareable JSON file by just clicking the button below the main window
		of Hoopla.</p>
		<h1>An Example</h1>
		<img src="../pics/example.png" alt="example" style="max-width: 80%;">
		<p>In principle, when studying the effects of gravitational lensing, we
		have specific names for the different objects under observation. We
		call the light-emitting object the source and the massive object the
		lens. What we see through our telescopes is called an the image plane.
		In this image plane, light from a distant galaxy (source) is being bent
		around a supermassive object (lens). The alignment of the source in
		relation to the lens produces this ring like images. In Hoopla, one can
		set up the source and lens by dragging your mouse in the blocks "Mass
		Model" and "Source Model" to draw ellipses, then move the cursor in the
		"Source Plane" block. You may see blue "circles" appearing in the
		"Image Plane" block. The goal of the game is: find the best models to
		make blue circles on top the lensed images in the "Images Plane" block.
		Once you are satisfied with the similarity between blue "circles" and
		the lensed images, you can use left click on the block "Source Plane"
		to activate freeze-model, then click the button "Submit your result" to
		submit your models.</p>
		<p>Briefly states, there are several steps for your to accomplish your model:</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="li-in-p">Randomly draw an ellipse in the "Mass Model" block first.</li>
			<li class="li-in-p">Randomly draw an ellipse in the "Source Model" block.</li>
			<li class="li-in-p">Move the mouse in the source "Source Plane" block.</li>
			<li class="li-in-p">Then some blue "circles" can be created in the "Images Plane" block.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You could obtain some lensed images now, but if no matter how you
		move the mouse, the similarity between the blue circles and lensed
		images does not satisfy you, you may drag the handles (large white
		points) on the ellipses to change the ellipticity, size, and
		orientation of the source and lens, and drag the center of the ellipse
		to relocate the lens and the source, then move the mouse again in the
		"Source Plane" block to reproduce blue circles. Should you want to
		restart, please just refresh the webpage. Repeating the steps above, I
		believe you could obtain a reasonable model of gravitation lensing of
		this image. If you obtain such a model, please do not forget to freeze
		it (right click) and submit it (the button below the Hoopla
		windows).</p>
		<p>The figure above shows one example of the model I created. Once can
		see the lens model and source model in the upper blocks, the relative
		position of the source is shown in the lower left block, and the lensed
		images are presented in the lower right block. To me, the similarity
		between the blue circles and lensed images is acceptable. If you could
		produce images like this, then congratulations, you are a gravitational
		lensing modeler now. (^_^)</p>
