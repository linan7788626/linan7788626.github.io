		<h1>What is Gravitational Lensing?</h1>

		<p>When we think of lenses, we often think of telescopes, magnifying
		glasses or binoculars. In all these devices, light enters one end of
		the device, gets warped and manipulated, then enters your eyes at the
		other. Gravitational lensing works under a similar principle. Light is
		emitted from distant objects, gets bent by the gravity of massive
		objects like stars and galaxies, and is observed by our telescopes and
		satellites. Simply, Gravitational lensing is when light curves around
		the gravity created by a large mass of galaxies. This typically results
		in seeing multiples of the same image of light, or an einstein ring -
		which is when the light is re-shaped in a ringlike structure.

		<p> This figure shows some confirmed images of gravitational lensing
		systems. The lenses come from a recently completed, large set of
		observations as part of a huge project to survey a single
		1.6-square-degree field of sky (nine times the area of the full Moon)
		with several space-based and Earth-based observatories. The COSMOS
		project, led by Nick Scoville at the California Institute of
		Technology, used observations from several observatories including the
		Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the XMM-Newton
		spacecraft, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Very Large Telescope
		(VLT), the Subaru Telescope, and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. (From <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/67_galaxies.html">NASA</a>)</p>
		<h1>Why is Gravitational Lensing Interesting?</h1>

		<p> The occurrence and morphology of lensed images reflect the
		properties of gravitational potential of the lens. It has become one of
		the most promising tools to study the mass distribution of the lenses
		and the geometry of the Universe. Lensing effects can be observed on
		all scales: weak lensing on the scale of Mpc, strong lensing on the
		scale of kpc, and micro lensing on the scale of pc. It is applied in
		astrophysics and cosmology to study a wide range of problems, e.g.,
		reconstructing mass distribution of lens, identifying faint or dark
		substructures, detecting galaxies at high redshift, measuring the
		Hubble constant, amongst other applications. Thus, gravitational
		lensing is a universal tool, it extremely useful for understanding the
		Universe both on large and small scales.</p>

		<h1>Gravitational Lensing in the Future</h1>

		<p>In 2023 the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will go online and start
		a 10 year survey of the sky. More examples of gravitational lensing
		will be found and huge amounts of data will be produced. It will be up
		to people outside the scientific community to help process through this
		data. At this point where there are few images of gravitational
		lensing, this help is relatively unnecessary. In the future however, it
		is an efficient way scientists will be able to collect meaningful data
		is through the diligent help of Citizen Scientists like you (another
		way is utilizing machine learning). This task can be pawned off to a
		computer but (so far) humans have the best ability to recognize the
		complex and unique structures of a lensed object. Based on this idea,
		we build up this <a href="../pages/citizenscience.html">Citizen
		Science</a> project for the highly efficient analysis of 
		gravitational lensing.</p>
