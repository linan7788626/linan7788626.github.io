		<h1><br />What is Gravitational Lensing?</h1>

		<p class="fixed-width">When we think of lenses, we often think of
		telescopes, magnifying glasses or binoculars. In all these devices,
		light enters one end of the device, gets warped and manipulated, then
		enters your eyes at the other. Gravitational lensing works under a
		similar principle. Light is emitted from distant objects, gets bent by
		the gravity of massive objects like stars and galaxies, and is observed
		by our telescopes and satellites. Simply, Gravitational lensing is when
		light curves around the gravity created by a large mass of galaxies.
		This typically results in seeing multiples of the same image of light,
		or highly distorted arclets images (perfectly, there will be an Einstein ring).</p>

		<p class="fixed-width" > This figure shows some confirmed images of
		gravitational lensing systems. The lenses come from a recently
		completed, large set of observations as part of a huge project to
		survey a single 1.6-square-degree field of sky (nine times the area of
		the full Moon) with several space-based and Earth-based observatories.
		The COSMOS project, led by Nick Scoville at the California Institute of
		Technology, used observations from several observatories including the
		Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the XMM-Newton
		spacecraft, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Very Large Telescope
		(VLT), the Subaru Telescope, and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

		<h1>Why is Gravitational Lensing Interesting?</h1>

		<a href="http://linan7788626.github.io/">
			<img class="fixed-width" src="../pics/lensingapplication.jpg" alt="lensingapplication">
		</a>
		<p class="fixed-width"> In the Universe, the occurrence and morphology
		of lensed images reflect the properties of gravitational potential of
		the lens. It has become one of the most promising tools to study the
		mass distribution of the lenses and the geometry of the Universe.
		Lensing effects can be observed on all scales: weak lensing on the
		scale of Mpc, strong lensing on the scale of kpc, and micro lensing on
		the scale of pc. It is applied in astrophysics and cosmology to study a
		wide range of problems, e.g., reconstructing mass distribution of lens,
		identifying faint or dark substructures, detecting galaxies at high
		redshift, measuring the Hubble constant, amongst other applications.
		Thus, gravitational lensing is a universal tool, it extremely useful
		for understanding the Universe both on large and small scales.</p>

		<h1>Gravitational Lensing in the Future</h1>
		<a href="https://pac.slac.stanford.edu/research/large-synoptic-survey-telescope-lsst">

		</a>
		<p class="fixed-width">In 2023 the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will go online and start
		a 10 year survey of the sky. More examples of gravitational lensing
		will be found and huge amounts of data will be produced. It will be up
		to people outside the scientific community to help process through this
		data. At this point where there are few images of gravitational
		lensing, this help is relatively unnecessary. In the future however, it
		is an efficient way scientists will be able to collect meaningful data
		is through the diligent help of Citizen Scientists like you (there
		would be an alnative way which is utilizing machine learning). This
		task can be pawned off to a computer but (so far) humans have the best
		ability to recognize the complex and unique structures of a lensed
		object. Based on the idea above, we build up this <a
			href="../pages/citizenscience.html">Citizen Science</a> project for
		the highly efficient analysis of a large set of gravitational lensing
		systems.</p>
