							<h2><font size="10"><strong>Simulations of Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters</strong></font><br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p> Cosmological strong gravitational lensing, in
						particular, probes the properties of the dense cores of
						dark matter halos over decades in mass and offers the
						opportunity to study the distant universe at flux
						levels and spatial reso- lutions that are otherwise
						unavailable. Strongly lensed variable sources offer yet
						further scientific opportunities. One of the challenges
						in realising the potential of strong lensing is in
						understanding the statistical context of both
						individual systems that receive extensive follow-up
						study, and the larger samples of strong lenses that are
						now emerging from survey efforts. Motivated by these
						challenges, my collaborators and I have developed a
						image-simulation pipeline to generate realistic strong
						gravitational lensing signals from group and
						cluster-scale lenses. This project has been the main
						focus of my work in the past two years.
						</p>

						<p>The goal of our pipeline is to produce simulated
						images that appear identical (to the eye, expert or
						otherwise) to real observations in various imaging
						surveys. The pipeline uses a low-noise and unbiased
						density estimator based on Delaunay Tes- sellations to
						calculate the density field, and lensed images are
						produced by ray-tracing images of actual galaxies from
						deep Hubble Space Telescope observations. Other
						galaxies, similarly sampled, are added to fill in the
						light cone. The pipeline adds cluster member galaxies
						and foreground stars onto the lensed images. The entire
						image ensemble is then observed using a realistic point
						spread function, including bright stars with
						appropriate detector artifacts. Noise is then added,
						including non-gaussian elements such as noise
						window-paning from mosaiced observations, residual bad
						pixels and cosmic rays, and the like. Figure 1. shows
				 comparison between simulated images and real observations for
				 Magellan Telescope. <a
				 href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1htSXLC6EsJ9SjwUY2dkaoonKl7RxxxFtnGw4CuRmXYo/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a>
						are some examples for deferent telescopes.</p>

							images in this figure. Can you tell which is which?</figcaption></a></p>

						<p>The priority application of the pipeline is strong
						lensing arc statistics. It is well known that the
						frequency of strongly lensed arcs on the sky reflects
						the abundance, concentration, and astrophysical
						properties of massive lenses. Thus, arc statistics help
						trace structure formation and can in principle
						constrain cosmological parameters. First, a full sky
						light cone is built based on the halos for which M500 >
						3 × 1014M⊙, from the Argonne Outer Rim simulation, one
						of the largest simulations currently available. Then
						the redshfit and positions of particles of a given halo
						can be obtained. By including these halos into the
						pipeline and setting the parameters for a given
						telescope (the Magellan Telescope by default),
						thousands of simulated images are produced. The
						statistical properties of simulated images are analyzed
						and compared to the optical follow-up results from the
						South Pole Telescope (SPT) cluster catalog (this last
						effort started in June 2015, see Figure 2).</p>

						<p>An auxiliary use for the pipeline is to test the
						preservation of morphological measurements, such as the
						Gini coefficient, under strong gravitational lensing.
						In particular, as the new generation of space-based
						large survey telescopes come online, such as the
						Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the
						number of observed strong lensing systems is expected
						to expand into the thousands. Such systems provide more
						detailed views of the internal structure of galaxies at
						higher redshift than would otherwise be possible,
						however the challenge is extracting useful
						morphological information from such data. It will be
						necessary to develop morphological measurements that
						are conserved under gravitational lensing and some
						elements of the pipeline described above have been used
						to test the reliability of image plane measurements of
						the Gini coefficient (Florian 2015).</p>
