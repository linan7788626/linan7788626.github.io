So far, lens finding is based on human effort because eyes of human are still the best tool to identify various and weird shapes of lensed images, such as lensed point sources (quasars and supernovas) and extend sources (galaxies). The size of observations is acceptable large (100 âˆ¼ 1000 lensing systems) for humans to look through. However, in next generation image surveys, e.g. LSST and WFRIST, there would be millions or even billions of images. It is an impossible mission for just several people to find lensing systems in such an enormous sample. There are too ways to deal with this situation. One is to ask help from citizen scientists, such as SpaceWarps4. The other one is designing an automatic approach. It has been proved in many fields that machine learning is a powerful tool to perform pattern recognition. I am very interested in applying machine learning to improve the algorithm of automatic lens finding. Likewise, there is similar problem (extremely large dataset) in lensing modeling, I expect that machine learning can lead to automatic lensing modeling as well.
